# CS 411 Summer 2020
## Course Project: Website
Through this project our main objective was to create a space for the UIUC community to engage in safe e-commerce activity i.e. to trade, buy, sell and rent commodities. This website like any other online marketplace website offers the ability for its users to sign up (exclusively using their @illinois.edu email ids), login, purchase and sell things of common use. We established a database with records of our users, products they wish to buy or sell and the purchases that they do on this website. The users on this website can search for the products using keywords, the products on the website are catalogued broadly as per the categories they fall into. We were able to implement services such as identifying top sellers in each category of product and generous sellers who sold products at a much lower cost than the actual market price. The website provides opportunity for its users to provide detailed reviews regarding the product they purchased and give ratings for the quality of product and the overall experience.
